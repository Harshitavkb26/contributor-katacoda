# Welcome to the kubernetes contributior Guide!

In this scenario, we'll work through the steps to set up Kubernetes in a Linux-based environment (here Ubuntu), that you might require to contribute to the project. Using this environment, we will also run some common tests to help you understand how the CI runs these tests when you open up a PR, and how you can run them in your environment as well!

More details can be found on [Kubernetes Contributors Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/README.md).
